# Note-Taker

This app is my first full stack application. It used heroku as a hosting service and I attach the front-end to the back-end as well as the middlewear.  

To get started you click on the button and then you can type in a note - hit the save button to save the data to the backend. Then you can click on the note to see the details you initially wrote. Lastly, you can hit the delete or trashcan button to remove the note from the database. Thank you for checking out my app!
